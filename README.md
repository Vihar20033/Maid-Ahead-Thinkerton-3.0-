# Maid Ahead 🧹🍳👶👵
A Smart Solution for Localized Maid Services

## 🚀 About the Project

**Maid Ahead** is a web-based platform developed during a hackathon with the goal of simplifying the process of booking trusted domestic help. It focuses on three essential services:

- 🏠 House Cleaning  
- 🍽️ Cooking  
- 👶 Baby Sitting  

And exclusively offers a **much-needed Elder Care service** — a feature currently missing in most mainstream maid service platforms.  
Unlike large-scale platforms, Maid Ahead starts at the **local level**, catering to specific neighborhoods and communities, ensuring trust, accessibility, and personalization.
